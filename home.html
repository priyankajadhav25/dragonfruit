	<h3>Dragon fruit<i>(Also called Pitaya or Pitahaya)</i></h3>
	<p>As the name suggests, dragon fruit is just that — a fruit.It’s grown primarily in Asia, Mexico, Central America, and South America, and historians think it originated in Central America.But the American Culinary Federation Education Foundation suggests a different story: <i>“Ancient Chinese legends say that the dragon fruit was created thousands of years ago by a dragon in battle who blew a burst of fire containing the fruit,”</i> its website states.
	If you’ve never heard of dragon fruit, you might be familiar with its other names: strawberry pear and pitaya or pitahaya.Dragon fruit (or pitaya) comes from a cactus of the type Hylocereus. It’s a fast-growing crop, and the plants can produce for more than 20 years once established.Dragon fruit is a food that grows on a climbing cactus called hylocereus, which you'll find in tropical regions around the world. The plant’s name comes from the Greek word <b>"hyle," </b>which means <b>"woody,"</b> and the Latin word <b>"cereus,"</b> which means <b>"waxen."</b> 
	On the outside, the fruit has the appearance of a hot pink or yellow bulb with spike-like green leaves shooting up like flames around it. Cut it open, and you'll find fleshy white stuff inside dotted with black seeds that are OK to eat.This fruit comes in red- and yellow-skinned varieties. The cactus originally grew in southern Mexico and South and Central America. The French brought it to Southeast Asia in the early 19th century.
	Central Americans call it <b>"pitaya."</b> In Asia, it's a <b>"strawberry pear."</b>Today, you can buy dragon fruit throughout the U.S.Dragon fruit is juicy with a slightly sweet taste that some describe as a cross between a kiwi, a pear, and a watermelon. The seeds have a nutty flavor.</p>

	<h3>Is a Dragon Fruit Sweet or Sour? <strong>What to Expect From Its Taste?</strong></h3>
	<p>Given dragon fruit’s unique appearance, you might hesitate to give it a try. But don’t let its spiky strangeness scare you. Dragon fruit will likely agree with your palate if you prefer sweet-tasting, rather than sour, fruit.
	Some people compare the taste of dragon fruit to a combination of kiwi and pear. So if you’re a fan of these types of fruit, there’s a pretty good chance you’ll fall in love with dragon fruit.Given dragon fruit’s unique appearance, you might hesitate to give it a try. But don’t let its spiky strangeness scare you. Dragon fruit will likely agree with your palate if you prefer sweet-tasting, rather than sour, fruit.
	Dragon fruit has a light, slightly sweet flavor that reminds folks of a cross between a pear and a  watermelon, with the consistency of a kiwi.However, its taste does not live up its exquisite looks. The fruit’s flavor differs when ripe and when unripe, and picking a ripe one is very difficult. 
	Dragon fruit does not have a definite taste when unripe; that is why most people say it tastes like nothing.Ripe dragon fruit has a slightly sweet and syrupy taste, while an unripe one tastes bland with some sourness.Moreover, it is not easy to tell the fruit’s real taste because the taste can differ from one person to another. What may taste very sweet to one person may taste very plain to another, so dragon fruit’s flavor is a bit elusive.</p>

	<h3>How to eat dragon fruit?</h3>
	<p>Despite the fruit’s sometimes bland taste, most people are using it because of its widespread benefits <b>(aside from looking cool)</b>.It has fiber, vitamin C, and omega-three fatty acids contained in its seeds. Due to its subtle taste, the fruit is in most cases blended with other fruits in frozen bowls or smoothies. 
	Here is a simple way to eat the dragon fruit: cut the fruit crosswise or in length, and eat its flesh using a spoon. You can also cut the fruit in quarters, peel off its skin starting from the pointed edge, if you want to extract the flesh with ease.A lot of fruits and vegetables have skin, membranes stalks, leaves, and stalks that aren’t edible. Dragon fruit is one of them. It has skin that is thinner and can be eaten as seeds. It is a good alternative for people who want the most bang for their money.
	There aren’t any special tools to cut the dragon fruit. Simply cut the fruit by cutting it in two from bottom to top, and take the pulp out. Each part is edible. If you’d prefer to peel off the skin just like you would peel off the skin of a banana.
	Dragon fruit is lovely to behold with its vivid and vibrant shades. Set them on the table for a centerpiece that can be eaten. The skins can be used when they’re taken off as mini-displays to hold desserts and ice cream!
	Dragon fruit is rich in fiber than other fruits and is rich in vitamin A, magnesium and calcium. It’s a great choice for vegans as it’s hard to obtain these nutrients without meat or dairy in certain instances.</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Pick a ripe fruit, it should have evenly colored skin, which is red, deep pink, or yellow.</li> 
	<li>Using a knife, slice the fruit in half by cutting straight through it.</li>
	<li>Peel off the skin and slice the flesh up or use a spoon to consume it.</li>

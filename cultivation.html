	<li><h3>Climate for Dragon Fruit </h3></li>
	<p>In recent years, Dragon Fruit has been a growing market in India with many farmers now trying their hands at this new crop. The fruit is usually grown in Thailand, Sri Lanka, Israel, and Vietnam but is now slowly gaining traction in India.One of the major merits of these crops is that it can grow in the extremes of temperature and the poorest of soils but is best suited for the tropical climate with an annual rainfall of <b>40-60 cm</b> best suited for growth.
	 Temperature ranging from <b>20°C- 30°C</b> is considered best for the crop to grow.</p>

	<li><h3>Soil Requirement for Dragon Fruit </h3></li>
	</p>Dragon Fruit can be grown on almost any soils however Sandy soils that have good irrigation are generally preferred. The ph of the soil should be between <b>5.5 to 6.5</b> for a good crop. Beds should be at least<b> 40-50 cm</b> high.</p>

	<li><h3>Planting</h3></li>
	<p>There are two methods of growing dragon fruit, the first is the use of seeds and the second is using a cutting from the plant sampling. Seeds take a time of three years before the plant is large enough to be used so farmers generally opt for the cutting method. The length of the sapling should be 20 cm and it should be cut from the mother plant and left in the shade for 5-7 days before being planted in the field.
	While being planted the distance between the dragon fruit plants depends on whether the support used is vertical or horizontal. In vertical support, the distance between the plants should be <b>2-3 metre</b> while in horizontal support the distance is reduced to almost 50 cm and allows for intensive farming.The vertical support should be between 1 to 1.20 meter high while the horizontal support should be between 1.40 to 1.60 metre for appropriate growth.</p>

	<li><h3>Pest Treatment for Dragon Fruit </h3></li>
	<p>The land should be treated with fertilisers in mounds. The fertilisers used should be <b>20-kilogram</b> organic fertilisers <b>0.5 kilograms</b> superphosphate and 1kg of NPK16-16-8 should be used per 50 postings before the actual plantings of dragon fruit plants.During the plantation stage, 50 grams of Urea combined with 50 grams of phosphate should be used three times a year during the first year.</p>

	<li><h3>Irrigation</h3></li>
	<p>Since the plant requires less water irrigation is recommended once a week and drip irrigation should be used for better efficiency.</p>

	<li><h3>Harvesting of Dragon Fruit</h3></li>
	<p>The fruit requires <b>27-30 days</b> to fully grow. The fruit should be picked as soon it is fully grown as even a delay of <b>4-5 days</b> can cause it to rot. The expected yield per hectare can vary from <b>10 to 30 hectares</b> depending on the conditions and techniques used. The techniques of picking it are twisting it in a clockwise direction and plucking it.</p>
